Beverages (Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales): Replace the labels on soft drink bottles with labels from different but similar-looking drinks. For example, swapping the labels of a cola and a root beer. The taste difference will be subtle but noticeable, leading to a moment of confusion.

Condiments (Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings): Mix a very small amount of harmless food coloring into a condiment like mayonnaise or mustard. The unexpected color change when they use it will be a surprise but won't alter the flavor.

Confections (Desserts, candies, and sweet breads): Prepare a dessert that looks like a savory item. For instance, a cake decorated to look like a pizza, or cupcakes that resemble mini burgers. The appearance will trick the eye, but the taste will reveal the sweet truth.

Grains/Cereals (Breads, crackers, pasta, and cereal): Swap the contents of cereal boxes with different kinds of cereals. Imagine reaching for cornflakes and finding fruity loops instead!

Meat/Poultry (Prepared meats): Create a 'faux' meat dish using vegetarian or vegan substitutes. For example, serving a vegetarian burger but presenting it as a regular beef burger. The key is to find a good quality substitute that is surprisingly similar in taste and texture.

Produce (Dried fruit and bean curd): Replace snacks like potato chips or cookies in a snack bowl with healthier alternatives like dried fruit or flavored bean curd. The unsuspecting snacker expecting a salty crunch might be surprised by the sweet or savory alternative.

Seafood (Seaweed and fish): Prepare a dish that looks like a classic seafood dish, like sushi, but use fruit or vegetable-based ingredients instead. For instance, making 'sashimi' slices from watermelon or mango.
